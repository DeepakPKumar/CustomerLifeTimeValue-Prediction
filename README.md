There are multiple ML Algorithms applied in this code. 
We first go through the Exploratory data analysis to understand the data spread
Visualize the data
Understand the outliers and apply the 97th percentile to bring them back into the range
Use OneHotEncoding ( Feature engineering ) to or Factor the data to convert the categorical variables.
Split the dataset to training and testset
Build various models to understand the correlation between the variables.
Here, i have used 
     1. Multiple Linear Regression
     2. Random Forest Regression
     3. XG Boost
     
I have compared all three models for accuracy and validated on test set.
