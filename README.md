We first go through the Exploratory data analysis to understand the data spread, Visualize the data <br>
Understand the outliers and apply the 97th percentile to bring them back into the range.<br>
Use OneHotEncoding ( Feature engineering ) to or Factor the data to convert the categorical variables. <br>
Split the dataset to training and testset <br>
Build various models to understand the correlation between the variables. <br>
Here, i have used  <br>
     1. Multiple Linear Regression <br>
     2. Random Forest Regression <br>
     3. XG Boost <br>
     
I have compared all three models for accuracy and validated on test set. <br>
XG Boost Model is stable and provides better accuracy for predicting CLV.
